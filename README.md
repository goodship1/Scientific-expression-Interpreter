Basic Operations

```python
1 + 1
10 - 1
100 * 200
20 /2
```
Power Operations
```python
10 ^ 2 # 100
e^3 # e raised to the 3rd power

```
Trig Operations
```python
cos(100)
cos(100) + tan(200)
1 + cos(100)
sin(200) + cos(300)
1 / sin(200)
10 * sin(200)
sin(200) - tan(200)

```
Root Operations
```python
roo(100) # 10 default is square root
root(1000 3) # cubed root
```
Log Opeartions

```python
log(100) # return 2 default base is 10
log(8 2) # returns can change the log bases
```
Sum to and Range  Operations
```python
1 ~ 1000 # sums for 1 to 1000
1..10 # [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] returns a range from 1 to 10 in array format
```
